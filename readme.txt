BULLET HELL ONSLAUGHT OF THE MEAN-SPIRITED ANCIENT DEITIES
by Alex Huang (LydianChord)


Instructions
------------
- You only take damage if something hits your red square, but a single hit kills you
- Defeat enemies to gain valor
- Whenever an enemy leaves the area, you lose valor
- A more difficult enemy will appear after you survive for a while
- There's a different outcome at the end if you don't kill any enemies, but that's pretty much impossible


Controls
--------
Z - fire/confirm
Shift - slow mode
Arrow keys - move
